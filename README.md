#  Algorithms in C language

## Overview
This is a repository for my C language algorithm assignments.

## What I could learn
Through the assignments, I could learn how things work in the lower level. Most of the exercises dosn't allow me to use libraries exept for "stdio.h". Therefore, I had to create methods that already exist in the libraries such as strlen(), map(), foreach() etc. That was good exercise to deepen my knowledge about higher languages.

Additionally, the concepts of malloc() and free() was very helpful to understand Apple's memory management with ARC. How to work with those two methods was also a good thing to know.

Overall, these assignments were very helpful for me to understand how things work under the hood.
